## How to Clone Properly
Before you can run the project you'll need the following technologies and dependencies:
  - [Java 22](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/download/) at least;
  - [Spring Boot](https://start.spring.io/);
  - JPA (Java Persistence API);
  - Jackson (for deserialization of JSON);
  - [Database (PostgreSQL)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/);
  - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi);
    
Clone the repository
    
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:dyonneEberty/Med.Voll.git
  ```

Configure the PostgreSQL database:
   - Create a database named "literalura"
   - In the file application.properties, `src/main/resources/application.properties`, you'll find [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables). You can either add those to your pc, setting your own information, or replace them with your info directly (I don't recomend this option if you want to post your project after finished because it will leak your infos but if you only wanna have fun it's much simpler).
